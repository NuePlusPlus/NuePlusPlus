# Hello!

<!--
**NuePlusPlus/NuePlusPlus** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

I'm not a developer, but a consumer just trying out stuff and things.
But I sometimes contribute, since I have <i>little</i> experience on some programming languages.

## Notes
* I rarely contribute. Most of the repositories i contribute are mostly joke repositories.
* I'm trying my best to learn on how to use git. Trust me I'm still learning.. (Â´ãƒ»Ï‰ãƒ»`)
